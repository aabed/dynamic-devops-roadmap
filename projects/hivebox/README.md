# Project: Hive Box

Almost everyone loves honey, and we at [DevOps Hive](https://devopshive.net/) love it and appreciate the role that bees play for the planet! Because [bees are essential to people and planet](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/why-bees-are-essential-people-and-planet).

For that reason, in this roadmap our main hands-on project will be for the bees! We will utilize the technology and open source software to build an API to track the environmental sensor data from [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/), a platform for open sensor data in which everyone can participate.

## Approach

This project follows the same Dynamic MVP-style mindset used in the [roadmap](../../). Which aims to cover the whole Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). That mean each phase of this project will cover all aspects of the DevOps areas like planning, coding, containers, testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, infrastructure, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> Each phase of this project is tackled gradually part of the roadmap modules. But it's also **standalone**, and you can work on it if you have the required knowledge for each phase.

> [!CAUTION]
> Remember, the goal is not only to implement the project but also to learn industry best practices in the DevOps field!
> Just applying this project without understanding what the problems to solve will not help you to be a DevOps Engineer!


## Goal

The goal of this project is to build a scalable RESTful API around [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/) but customized to help beekeeper with their chores. The API output should be in JSON. You will start with a basic implementation, then extend the whole system to handles thousands of requests per second. But always remember, every decision has a cost.

You can get senseBox IDs by checking the [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/) website. Use 3 senseBox IDs close to each other (you can use this one [5eba5fbad46fb8001b799786](https://opensensemap.org/explore/5eba5fbad46fb8001b799786) as starting point). Just copy the IDs, you will need them in the next steps.
