## The Problem

<p align="center">

</a>

The `DevOps Engineer` role remains one of the top 10 most in-demand jobs across all industries (not just the tech field!). However, starting that role is super challenging because the DevOps model has various patterns and topologies. Also, the Cloud Native landscape keeps expanding, and there is something new every day!

It's even more complicated if that's your first job without previous software industry experience (coming from either dev or ops).

For that reason, almost every day, I see people struggling on their way to start as fresh/junior DevOps engineers or even progress in their early career years in general. They usually follow some `linear` roadmap like [roadmap.sh/devops](https://roadmap.sh/devops). But still, they cannot land their first job or straggle a lot when they find one! And sadly, many of them eventually give up!

## The Solution

<p align="center">
  <a href="img/dynamic-devops-roadmap.png" imageanchor="1">
    <img alt="Dynamic MVP-style roadmap Good and Bad" border="0" width="90%" src="img/dynamic-devops-roadmap.png" />
  </a>
</p>

Based on experience for years mentoring people in different stages (starting their first job, career shift, moving to another work style or company), using a `dynamic MVP-style roadmap` with hands-on projects designed by an experienced DevOps engineer has been highly successful.

That means **first, understand the problem instead of just learning a bunch of tools** then **using iterative style each iteration will cover all/most DevOps areas used in the job** to build a T-shaped skills profile from day one! It's also essential to set the targeted market and organizations because, with different DevOps topologies, the DevOps engineer role requirements vary a lot.

## Hands-on Project

One essential aspect of this roadmap is using real hands-on industry-grad project to learn DevOps in pragmatic manner. The project is done in iterative phases where you learn as you go and cover the whole DevOps cycle like Code, Containers, Testing, Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Observability, and Infrastructure.

</p>

> [!NOTE]
> Each phase of this project is tackled gradually part of the roadmap modules. But it's also **standalone**, and you can work on it if you have the required knowledge for each phase.

## Agile Board

Another critical aspect is that it utilizes Agile methodologies like Epics and Kanban board to implement the plan, incorporating real-world scenarios and best practices, which you will use in a real job when working in an Agile environment.
